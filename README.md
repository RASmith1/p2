# **Description sentences**
P2: PHP Basics project introduces the student developer to a groundwork of PHP fundamentals.  
The project itself is an xkcd password generator.  The implementation of this password
generator provides opportunities for the student to use the fundamentals of PHP taught
in the class lectures and sections.  This includes a focus on separation of concern via 
separating out header/footer, content, and logic PHP files and the separation of CSS into a 
a separate file/directory.  Fundamental PHP skills gained during this project's 
implementation include the use of associative arrays, $_POST, conditional statements, iterative
statements, PHP syntax, debugging, and form manipulation.

# **Demo information** 
A recording was submitted with this project.  The link for the recording is:
http://screencast.com/t/MzpXhGsyPccp 
I was able to access this recording link in multiple browsers, but it was the quickest
in Chrome for some reason, possibly my browser settings.

# **Details for Teaching Team**
No login is required.
This project works well in Firefox, Chrome, and IE.  
My words.txt file is in the project root directory, p2.  
To install a dictionary, I did the following:
    SSH'd to my local server
    sudo apt-get install wbritish
    cat /usr/share/dict/words > words.txt
I used the Brackets editor/previewer to implement this project.
I liked the way the UI in the fourth example in the P2 specs worked, so I
implemented similar features and embelished the look of it.

# **Outside Code**
No outside code was used in this project.  I did use an image of vintage wallpaper/background for
the background of my web page.  I don't remember where I got it from, but I used it for a web 
project in CSCI E12, and I remember I went through the exercise of ensuring I didn't need to note 
the source of it then.
